## Why using Clerc?

Clerc uses [`type-flag`](https://github.com/privatenumber/type-flag) to parse arguments. It is strongly-typed, which brings you better DX. It is powerful(supports custom type) and quite small!

And clerc uses [`lite-emit`](https://github.com/so1ve/lite-emit) to emit events. It is a event emitter library but with better type support.

The whole bundled and minified `@clerc/core` package is only 10KB (ignored types), which is much smaller than yargs, commander, CAC and oclif :)

## Why naming "Clerc"?

Hiroki Osame's [`cleye`](https://github.com/privatenumber/cleye) is an awesome tool for building CLI apps. Its name sounds quite nice, so I also found an English name `Clerc` for this package =)
